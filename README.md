2. **Images**: Consider adding additional images or graphics to enhance the visual appeal, particularly for the About page sections.

3. **Content Refinement**: The current content provides a solid foundation but can be further enhanced with more specific statistics, use cases, or testimonials about domain value.

4. **Google Analytics**: Update the Google Analytics tracking ID placeholder with the actual tracking ID when available.
